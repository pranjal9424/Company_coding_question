    Stone Age Marriage Goals 
         There is a family consisting of a husband-wife from Stone Age. Every day, the husband goes fishing in the sea and brings a certain number of fishes for food at the end of the day. The mood of the wife i.e.to be happy or sad depends on the number of fishes' husband brings back home. Everyday wife updates record of 'max' and 'min' fishes husband caught. She gets happy only when the husband brings more fishes than 'max' of the all the previous day and gets sad when he brings fewer fishes than 'min' of the all previous day. Write a program to predict the overall happiness of the wife with her husband. Create your own logic to define the "overall" happiness and clearly state your assumptions.
