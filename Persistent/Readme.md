Q 4.	Statement

Andrew is a stock trader who trades in N selected stocks. He has calculated the relative stock price N stocks from the previous day stock prices. Now, his lucky number is K, so he wishes to invest in stock that has the Kth smallest relative stock value. Write an algorithm for Andrew to find the Kth smallest stock price out of the selected N stocks.

			5

	Output:	9 -3 8 -6 -7 18 10
	
	Explanation: the sorted relative stock prices are [-7,-6,-3,8,9,10,18]. So ,the 5th smallest stock price is 9

Q 5. Statement

A cloud computing company can accommodate various requirerments for resources The company system runs twa servers. For load batencing purposes, the load of the resources gets transferred to the servers one by one Initisly, the first request gpes to server 1, the net request goes to server 2, and so on. The requests served by the servers are of two types ie one for memory allocation(denoted by a positive rumber and the ather for memory dealliocation (dencted by a negative number)

	Input: 	7
			2 -3 8 -6 -7 18 1 
			
	Output: 4

	Explanation: The requests served by server 1 are [2,8,-7,1]. So, the total processing time of server 2 is 4.

Q 6.	Statement

In a science research lab, combining two nuclear chemicals produces a maximum energy that is the product of the energy of the two chemicals. The energy values of the chemicals can be negative or positive. The scientist wishes to calculate the sum of the maximized energies of the two elements when the reaction happens. Write an algorithm to find the total energy produced by the chemicals when the reaction happens.

		Input:	7
				9 -3 8 -6 -7 8 10

		Output: 19

		Explanation: The maximum product of the energies is 90, i.e. 9 10. So, the sum of the energies of the chemicals is 19

Q 7.	Statement

An agent sends a message to headquarters containing the details of his project. He sends one soft copy to the agency's computer (P) and sends one hard copy by fax to Roger, the technical head of the agency (Q). But during the transmission, noise in the network causes some bits of the data message P to get distorted. However, we know that Roger always matches the binary values of both messages and checks whether he can convert the message P to message Q by flipping the minimum number of bits. Write an algorithm to help Roger find the minimum number of bits that must be flipped to convert message P to message Q

	Input:	7 10

	Output:	3

	Explanation: Binary representation of P is 00000111. Binary representation of Q is 0000101O. Three bits of P at position 5, 6 and 8 must be flipped 3 bit.

Q 8.	Statement	

A company is transmitting its data to another server. To secure the data against malicious activity, they plan to reverse the data before transmitting. They want to know the number of data characters that do not change position even after the data stream is reversed. The network administrator has been tasked with ensuring the smooth transmission of the data Write an algorithm for the network administrator to help him find the number of data characters that do not change position even after the data stream is reversed.

	Input: 	alphxxdida

	Output:	4

	Explanation: The reversed data stream is "adidxxhpla". The characters that do not change position after the data stream is reversed are the characters 'a' at the start and end position and the characters 'x' in the middle positions.

Q 9. 	Statement

A company manufactures different types of software products. They deliver their products to their N clients. Whenever the company fulfills the complete order of a client, the orderID generated is the concatenation of the number of products delivered for every committed product type. The head of the sales team wishes to find the clientwise data for the total number of products of any type delivered to every client. Write an algorithm for the head of sales team to calculate the total number of products of any type delivered to the respective clients

	Input:	4
			43 345 20 987 
			
	Output: 7 12 2 24 

Q 10.	Statement

	Output:	2
	
	Explanation:	the bill amounts that are perfect square are 25 and 81. So output is 2.

Q 11. 	Statement

A cold storage company has N storage unit for various products. The company has received N orders that must be preserved respective N temperatures inside the storage units. The company manager wishes to identify which products must be preserved at negative temperatures. Write an algorithm to help the manager find the number of products that have negative temperature storage requirements.

	Input: 	4
			-3 2-5 7
