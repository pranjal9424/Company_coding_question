Q 1.

     Checking if a given year is leap year or not?

Q 2. 

     Ques. Write a code to check whether no is prime or not. Condition use function check() to find whether entered
     no is positive or negative ,if negative then enter the no, And if yes pas no as a parameter to prime() and check whether no is prime or not?
     Whether the number is positive or not, if it is negative then print the message please enter the positive number
     It is positive then call the function prime and check whether the take positive number is prime or not.

Q 3. 

     Number Series with a Twist  1
     Find the 15th term of the series?
     0,0,7,6,14,12,21,18, 28

Q 4. 

     Number Series with a Twist 2
     Consider the following series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27, 16, 81, 32, 243, 64, 729, 128, 2187 
     This series is a mixture of 2 series  all the odd terms in this series form a geometric series and all the even terms form yet another geometric series. Write a program to find the Nth term in the series.
     The value N in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN. The Nth term that is calculated by the program
     should be written to STDOUT. Other than value of n th term,no other character / string or message should be written to STDOUT. For example , if N=16, the 16th term in the series is 2187, so only value 2187 should be printed to STDOUT.
     You can assume that N will not exceed 30.

Q 5. 

     Number Series with a Twist 3
     Consider the below series :
     0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7, 16, 8
     This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous term using the formula (x/2)
     Write a program to find the nth term in this series.
     The value n in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN the nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than the value of the nth term no other characters /strings or message should be
     written to STDOUT.
     For example if n=10,the 10 th term in the series is to be derived from the 9th term in the series. The 9th term is 8
      so the 10th term is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed to STDOUT.
      You can assume that the n will not exceed 20,000.

Q 6. 

     String with a Twist
     1. The program will recieve 3 English words inputs from STDIN
          1.These three words will be read one at a time, in three separate line
          2.The first word should be changed like all vowels should be replaced by %
          3.The second word should be changed like all consonants should be replaced by #
          4.The third word should be changed like all char should be converted to upper case
          5.Then concatenate the three words and print them Other than these concatenated word, no other characters/string should or message should be written to STDOUT

     For example if you print how are you then output should be h%wa#eYOU. You can assume that input of each word will not exceed more than 5 chars
Q 7. 

     Addition of two numbers a Twist
     Using a method, pass two variables and find the sum of two numbers.
        Test case:
                 Number 1  20
                 Number 2  20.38
                 Sum = 40.38
        There were a total of 4 test cases. Once you compile 3 of them will be shown to you and 1 will be a hidden one.
        You have to display error message if numbers are not numeric.

Q 8. 

     Consider the below series :
          0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7,
     This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous term using the formula (x/2)
     Write a program to find the nth term in this series.
     The value n in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN the nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than the value of the nth term no other characters /strings or message should bewritten to STDOUT.
     For example if n=10,the 10 th term in the series is to be derived from the 9th term in the series. The 9th term is 8
     so the 10th term is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed to STDOUT.
     You can assume that the n will not exceed 20,000.

Q 9. 

     Sweet Seventeen Problem Statement
     Given a maximum of four digit to the base 17 (10  A, 11  B, 12  C, 13  D  16  G} as input, output its decimal value.
     Case 1
         Input  1A
         Expected Output  27
     Case 2
         Input  23GF
         Expected Output  10980

Q 10. 

     Given a maximum of 100 digit numbers as input, find the difference between the sum of odd and even position digits
      Case 1
           Input: 4567
           Expected Output: 2
      Explanation : Odd positions are 4 and 6 as they are pos: 1 and pos: 3, both have sum 10. Similarly, 5 and 7 are at even positions pos: 2 and pos: 4 with sum 12. Thus, difference is 1

Q 14.

      Problem Statement (Word is Key)
      One programming language has the following keywords that cannot be used as identifiers:

      (break, case, continue, default, defer, else, for, func, goto, if, map, range, return, struct, type, var)

      Write a program to find if the given word is a keyword or not

      Test cases
          Case 1
             Input – defer
          Output – defer is a keyword

Q 15. 

     Find the nth term of the series.

      1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27, 16, 81, 32, 243,64, 729, 128, 2187 ….

      This series is a mixture of 2 series – all the odd terms in this series form a geometric series and all the even terms form yet another geometric series. Write a program to find the Nth term in the series.

      The value N in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN.
      The Nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT.
      Other than value of n th term,no other character / string or message should be written to STDOUT.
      For example , if N=16, the 16th term in the series is 2187, so only value 2187 should be printed to STDOUT.
      You can assume that N will not exceed 30.

      Test Case 1
      Input- 16
      Output – 2187
Q 16  

      Consider the below series:
      1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 5, 11, 8, 13, 13, 17…..
      This series is a mixture of 2 series fail the odd terms in this series form a Fibonacci series and all the even terms are the prime numbers in ascending order
      Write a program to find the Nth term in this series
      The value N in a positive integer that should be read from mm. The Nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT Otherthan the value of Nth term , no other characters / string or message should be written to STDOUT.

      For example, when N:14, the 14th term in the series is 17 So only the value 17 should be printed to STDOUT

Q 19. 

       Cliff and Radar
           Two cliffs of lengths X and Y join at one end and enclose a body of water. The angle between the cliffs, phi, is known. A radar is installed at the 
           point where the cliffs are joined. It has a range of m where m < X and m < Y. Calculate the area of the water enclosed between the cliffs which 
           cannot be scanned by the radar and the distance between the end points of two cliffs.

               Input Format: First line contains length of cliff AB, denoted by X in meters
                             Second line contains length of cliff AC, denoted by Y in meters
                             Third line contains range of radar, denoted by m in meters
                             Fourth line contains angle BAC in degrees, denoted by (phi)

                             On second line, print the distance between end points of two cliffs in meters


              note : Calculations should be done upto 11-digit precision, but output values should be printed upto 5 decimal places


Q 20. 

       The power of compounding
          Manish has realized the power of compounding. Since the days he started earning, he has diligently set aside a small corpus which he saves from his monthly 
          salary and deposits in his bank account. Bank pays him interest every month. Manish is also a determined investor and refrains from withdrawing anything from this 
          account because he now believes in power of compounding. Given investment corpus, fixed annual rate of interest and maturity period calculate the amount the Manish 
          will end up saving at the end of his tenure.

                 Input Format : First line contains investment corpus P
                                Second line contains rate of interest per annum R
                                Third line contains tenure T (in months)
                 Output Format : Maturity amount should be printed, rounded off to its nearest integer value
